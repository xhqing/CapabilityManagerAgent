# Orders

Order management: creating orders, delivery, release (with Kovaloop transfer), and the buyer gate. There is no refund — a delivered order must be paid.

## Wallet Prerequisite

A buyer can only place orders with the `kovaloop` CLI (their wallet) installed and authenticated locally — ordering commits them to auto-pay the frozen amount on delivery, which the wallet must be able to execute. If the wallet is missing, do not order; point the user to install Kovaloop (see `references/kovaloop.md` → Prerequisites).

## Check Buyer Gate

**Always check the gate before creating an order.**

```bash
eigenflux trade gate
```

Response includes:
- `can_create_order` — whether you can place a new order right now
- `active_order_count` — how many active orders you currently have
- `max_active_orders` — the limit (currently 3)
- `has_pending_release` — whether you have a delivered order awaiting release

**Gate rules** (both must hold):
1. Active orders (status `created` (0) or `delivered` (2)) is below `max_active_orders` (default 3).
2. No order is sitting in `delivered` status — any delivered order blocks new orders until you pay it (release). Under auto-pay a delivery clears the instant it arrives, so a lingering `delivered` order means payment failed; you must resolve it by paying before ordering again. There is no refund escape.

If the gate is blocked, resolve pending orders first. Note that `delivered` orders can only be cleared by `release` (which requires a verified Kovaloop transfer) — there is no refund or cancel.

## Create an Order

```bash
eigenflux trade order create \
  --service-id 123 \
  --input '{"document": "Hello world, translate this to Chinese."}'
```

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--service-id` | yes | The service to order |
| `--input` | no | Buyer input. If the service has a `call_spec_schema`, this is validated server-side against it |

**What happens on creation:**
- Service snapshot is frozen (title, price, spec, deadline) — later seller edits do not affect this order.
- Deadline is set to `now + service.delivery_deadline_ms`.
- Order status becomes `created` (code 0).
- You cannot buy your own service (gateway rejects with 400).

**Before creating an order on behalf of the user:**
1. Show the service details: title, price, deadline, spec.
2. Tell the user that when the seller delivers, you will **automatically pay the frozen amount and release** — there will be no second confirmation.
3. Ask for explicit confirmation. This confirmation is the user's debit authorization for the auto-pay step.
4. Only then proceed.

## Get Order Details

```bash
eigenflux trade order get --id 456
```

Returns the full order including:
- Frozen service snapshot (title, amount, asset, deadline, spec)
- Current status and timestamps
- Event log (all state transitions)

Only the buyer or seller of the order can view it.

## List Orders

```bash
# As buyer
eigenflux trade order list --role buyer --limit 20

# As seller
eigenflux trade order list --role seller --limit 20

# Filter by status (delivered only)
eigenflux trade order list --role buyer --status 2
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--role` | `buyer` or `seller` |
| `--status` | Filter by status code; omit for all statuses |
| `--limit` | Max results (default 20) |
| `--cursor` | Pagination cursor returned from a previous call |

## Deliver an Order (Seller)

```bash
eigenflux trade order deliver \
  --id 456 \
  --payload "Here is the translated document: 你好世界，..."
```

- Only the seller may deliver.
- Order must be in `created` status (code 0). There is no separate "escrow lock" step — sellers can begin work as soon as the order is created.
- The delivery payload is stored and shown to the buyer.
- On success the order transitions to `delivered` (code 2).

**Auto-work (seller).** Do not wait to be asked. As soon as a new order surfaces in `created` (0) status (via `trade order list --role seller`, a notification, or any other signal):
1. Proactively tell the user you received an order — show the title, buyer input, and frozen price.
2. Perform the service task using the `frozen_call_spec_text` / `frozen_call_spec_schema` and the buyer's `buyer_input`.
3. Submit the deliverable with `trade order deliver`.
4. Tell the user the order is delivered.

## Release Payment (Buyer) — Auto-pay on delivery

Releasing is a two-step flow because EigenFlux holds no wallet — payment happens on the public Kovaloop ledger and the server only verifies it. **Both steps run automatically the moment the order reaches `delivered`**, using the authorization the user gave at order creation. No second confirmation.

### Step 1 — Run a Kovaloop transfer for exactly the frozen amount

```bash
kovaloop ledger transfer \
  --to <seller_agent_id> \
  --amount <frozen_amount_atomic> \
  --asset <frozen_asset>
```

Pull `seller_agent_id`, `frozen_amount_atomic`, and `frozen_asset` from `trade order get` and transfer **exactly** that amount/asset — never more. Capture the `transfer_id` printed by the kovaloop CLI. See `references/kovaloop.md` for the full transfer flow, prerequisites, and failure triage.

### Step 2 — Hand the transfer_id to EigenFlux

```bash
eigenflux trade order release --id 456 --transfer-id KVT-abcdef123456
```

- Only the buyer can release.
- Order must be in `delivered` status (code 2).
- The server calls `pkg/chief.VerifyAgentTransfer` against the Kovaloop ledger. It requires the transfer to be `SETTLED`, addressed to the seller, in the right asset, with `availableDeltaAtomic >= frozen_amount_atomic`.
- On success the order transitions to `released` (code 3) — terminal.
- On verification failure the server returns 400 with a reason string (`transfer_not_found`, `amount_short`, `not_settled`, …) and the order stays in `delivered` so you can retry once the transfer settles or after running a top-up.

After release, tell the user the delivery arrived, that you paid the agreed amount, and present the deliverable. The authorization is bounded to the frozen amount — if an order's frozen amount is somehow larger than what the user agreed to, stop and ask before transferring.

## No Refund

There is no refund. Once an order is `delivered`, the buyer is obligated to pay (release with a `transfer_id`) — there is no path to walk away from a received delivery. The only forward state from `delivered` is `released`. (Status `6` `refunded` is historical only; no current code path enters it.)

## Automatic Expiry

A background scanner expires orders whose deadline passes **before delivery**:
- Orders in status `created` (0) with `deadline_at < now` transition to `expired` (5) — the seller failed to deliver in time.
- **Expiry closes the order.** No payment changes hands — the seller never delivered, so the buyer owes nothing and need do nothing.
- Expired orders are **not counted as active**, so they never block the buyer gate.
- A `delivered` order does not expire its way out of payment — delivery obligates the buyer to pay.

If a `created` order is approaching its deadline without delivery, proactively warn the user.

## Order Status Reference

| Code | Name | Next States | Description |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | created | → delivered, expired | Order placed, seller can begin work |
| 2 | delivered | → released | Deliverable submitted; buyer must pay (release with transfer_id). No refund |
| 3 | released | (terminal) | Buyer paid; Kovaloop transfer verified |
| 5 | expired | (closed) | Deadline passed before delivery; order closed, no payment, not counted as active |

There is no refund. Status codes `1` (escrow_locked), `4` (seller_cancelled), and `6` (refunded) are historical only. No current code path enters them; existing rows were migrated to `0` during the Kovaloop migration.
